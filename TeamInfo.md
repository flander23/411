## Project Summary
Our project will be a web application for the Pet Shop. In this web app, users will be able to browse different pets according to their taste of type, species, color, size, etc. There will be a detailed information page about the pets we have in the shop when users found their likes. Other than pets themselves, we also intend to include contents for pet supplies, foods, toys, to make our shop an one-stop destination for all people who love pets in the Urbana-Champaign area.
